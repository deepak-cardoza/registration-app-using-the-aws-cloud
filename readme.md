# Setting up AWS Registration App

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up an AWS account, create an Amazon RDS instance, set up a REST API in Amazon API Gateway, and create an AWS Lambda function to handle registration and login for a registration app.

## 1. Creating an AWS Account

To create an AWS account, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) website.
2. Click on the "Create an AWS Account" button.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the registration process, including providing your contact information, payment details, and identity verification.
4. Once your account is created, log in to the AWS Management Console.

## 2. Setting up Amazon RDS Instance

To set up an Amazon RDS instance, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
2. Go to the Amazon RDS service.
3. Click on "Create database" and select the engine type (e.g., MySQL).
4. Configure the database settings, including instance type, storage, username, and password.
5. Choose the VPC and subnet settings.
6. Review the settings and click "Create database" to create the RDS instance.

## 3. Creating a REST API in Amazon API Gateway

To create a REST API in Amazon API Gateway, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
2. Go to the Amazon API Gateway service.
3. Click on "Create API" and choose the REST API type.
4. Configure the API settings, including name, description, and endpoint type.
5. Define your API resources and methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
6. Configure the integration with your backend services or Lambda functions.
7. Deploy the API to a stage (e.g., development, production).

## 4. Creating an AWS Lambda Function and Uploading the Code

To create an AWS Lambda function and upload the code, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
2. Go to the AWS Lambda service.
3. Click on "Create function" and choose the option to author from scratch.
4. Configure the function settings, including name, runtime (e.g., Node.js), and execution role.
5. Write or upload your Lambda function code.
6. Configure triggers, such as API Gateway or S3 events.
7. Click "Deploy" to deploy the Lambda function.
